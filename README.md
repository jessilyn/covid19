# covid19
A home repo for coordinating data science research activities at Duke around SARS-CoV-2/COVID19. Note most content / discussion currently lives in open Issues. 

## Current Efforts

- **Launching phone survey with Clarity Consulting Group:** We're about to launch a survey primarily focused on objective measures of social distancing in North Carolina. Contact: @nickeubank
- **Looking for location-tracking firm willing to share:** Location tracking firms likely have the very best data for measuring social distancing acccurately and at scale. See Issue #4 . Contact: @nickeubank
- **Writing NSF Grant for phone surveys to allow for greater frequency / sample sizes:** Currently I think AC is focused on this?

## Other Resources

We're also trying to use this site as a clearing house for good data we find elsewhere, and to alert people to the efforts of others to avoid duplication of effort. See `third_party_data.md` for a list of currently available public data.

And finally, we'll keep trying to accumulate links on other research efforts. For example, [here's a git repo trying to track various social science projects in this domain.](https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research)
